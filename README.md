# riscv_staged_processor

This project contains a component-based emulator for a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor written in Rust. Its purpose is mostly to be an education tool by showing how instructions flow
through a pipelined processor, but the project has also served as an exercise using the Rust programming language.
